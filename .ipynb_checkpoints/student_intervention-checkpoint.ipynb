    "**Answer: ** The three supervised learning models that will be used in this project are Gausian Naive Bayes, support vector classifier, and decision tree classifier. The naive bayes classifiers work well in most real world situations without the need for alot of data. They work faster than other sophisticated methods, due to theoretical reasons which allieve the curse of dimensionality. Nevertheless, they are known to be bad estimators, so outputs from 'predict_proba' should be taken cautiously. I choose gausian naive bayes classifier to allieviate the limited data. More specifically we have 41 features to analyze, coordinated with limited training examples. Next the decision tree advantages are: easy to interpret visually, cost of using tree is logarithmic, can handle both categorical and numerical training data, can handle multi output models. The disadvantages to decision trees include easy overfitting, and the trees could be biased if training examples have dominant classes. I choose decision trees for this model since it flows well after a quick analysis with the naive bayes classifier. Finally the SVC model will be applied with the data. The advantages of support vector machines are: great in high dimensional spaces, effetive when dimensions are greater than number of samples, versatile when kernel functions are applied. The disadvantages of support vector machines are: an expensive five-fold cross-validation must be used to provide probability estimates, and if the number of features are much greater than the number of samples - the performance is poor. I choose support vector classification since we have a high ratio of features to training samples while not having more features than training samples. Furthermore I will share some applicaitions. According to the suggested wikipedia, I found decision tree classifiers have been widely used in IBM SPSS Modeler, RapidMiner, SAS Enterprise Miner, Matlab, and R. These are well known software and I personally have used them as well. For support vector machines, practical applications include protein function prediction, protease functional site recognition, transcription initiation site prediction and gene expression data classification. This hits home because I am a bioengineer by schooling. For Naive Bayes, typical applications include marking an email as spam, classifying a news article, and checking a piece of text expressing positive emotions, or negative emotions, etc.  "

When training data is limited, support vectors classifiers also performed better in comparison to the other two models. Although the most expensive model was support vector classification. Furthermore it's been realized that the SVM is the most expensive in time vs cost. Therefore the small dataset makes computational cost less relevant. In a separate situation, one could choose a model based on limited data, resources, cost and peroformance. In this situation the decision tree classifier would be the best."

    ">The final chosen model was the support vector classifier. The classifier is named because it separates the data to corresponding classes or outputs. Furthermore when the data is separated, the distance between the separation of classes is referred to as margins. The algorithm selects the best line that separates the two classes. The best line not only separates the two classes, but also has the highest margins, being as far as possible from the classes but still in between. This is easier to visualize with two dimensions, but is applicable to a feature set with more. It is also important to note, that different kernels could be applied and one can use more than just lines, such as a rbf or polynomial kernels. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">For example a student would represent one data point if we're looking at a 2 dimensional plane representing a 2 dimensional feature set. If we have many students in this plot, students who need intervention would be closer together, and students who don't need intervention would in a different location in the plot and close to other similar points. These two different locations could be separated by a line. The svm / svc algorithm would find a line with the correct slope and y intercept so that these two locations are separated by a classifier line as close as to the middle as possible. Furthermore if a new point is introduced to this model, it would use the location of the new point and the line to classify whether a student is needing intervention or not. More specifically it will classify according to previous data points on that side of the line. "

The untuned scores were lower because not all parameters have been tested. More specifically the gridsearch algorithm did an exhaustive search looking for lower error rates when training and testing. This kept the initial untuned f1 training score around the same at .87 but increased f1 testing score from around .77 to .8169."
